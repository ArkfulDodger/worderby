# Worderby 2.0 - In Development

Worderby is a competitive 2-player mobile word game (both iOS + Android) where you continuously chain words off of the last word played in order to score points. The game can be played as multiplayer online across devices or as a single-player against Worderbot (the game's AI bot).
